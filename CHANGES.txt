--------------------

- Add check to see if getTypeInfo can be None (which is a valid value)
  [tesdal]

  customized NotFound handling.

  environment.
  [hannosch]

  is missing. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8133.
  [hannosch]

- Changed wording on the IMailAction interface to remove a reference to a
  newly created item, since the action can be used on existing content
  as well. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8225.
  [hannosch]


1.1 - April 20, 2008

  necessary for the <base /> URL to be set correctly.

  rules, actions and conditions, at time resorting to some serious
  Cowboy Development.
  [optilude]

- Adjusted tests for different payload in newer kss versions.
  [hannosch]
