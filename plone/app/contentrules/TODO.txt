 Known issues
 ------------
 
  - IObjectAddedEvent executes too early when using Archetypes content objects
    (before the object is initialised from user input, leading to various 
    errors with move-to-folder, copy-to-folder or transition-workflow as
    actions). Therefore, we are using IObjectInitializedEvent from AT, but 
    this is AT specific. Plain-CMF content types are probably a lost cause,
    because we don't have a well-defined event for when they are first 
    initialised. Zope 3 content types or anything with a proper add form
    would work with IObjectAddedEvent, but then the user would have to know
    which one to use.
    
    One option is to listen for IObjectAddedEvent and check for IBaseObject.
    When an AT object is received, delay executing the rule until a subsequent
    IObjectInitializedEvent is received for the same object in the same 
    request. This would still cause problems with plain-CMF content types,
    but would work with items with proper add forms.
    
    This may not be that much of an issue at this point in time, but may be
    going forward.
 
  - Move-to-folder, copy-to-folder actions require the user to know
    absolute Zope physical paths, which sucks. We need a decent selection
    wiget!
 
  - Add and edit forms don't use Plone styling
    -> need to integate with plone.app.form
    
  - Tests for event handling not in place
    
  - We depend on plone.memoize implicitly because we assume the request is
    annotatable.
    
 Design
 ------
 
  - Rule enabled/disabled
  - Bubble up looking for rules
  - Library of standard rules
  - Move/copy rules
  
  - Re-visit reliance on Node
      - consider pattern in zope.app.content, marking element interfaces like
        ILoggerAction with an IInterface like IRuleActionType
      - queryType() can find such interfaces
      - the interface may tell us enough about a type
          - how to get name, description of the element type?
          - how to get edit view (can rely on edit.html convention)

 Views
 -----
 
   - UI for re-ordering rules?
      
 Conditions
 ----------
 
  Make a "disjunction" pseudo-condition to allow "or'ing" of conditions.
    
    When multiple conditions are in effect, they become a conjunction, since
    any condition can veto the next step and cancel rule execution. We could
    have a "containerish" condition that provided add/remove functionality
    for multiple conditions and, upon execution, did all and returned True
    if any returned True. This should otherwise mimic the add/edit environment
    so that any condition could be used.
    
 Actions
 -------
  
  Add more actions, such as:

  - Rename
     need some kind of pattern for it to be useful, otherwise you hardcode
     the new name and it only works once...
     
  - Send email
